#  excerpt:
---
Reality and imagination are intertwined like the braided hair of a woman. Life is full of real imaginations and imaginary realities. I never stopped daydreaming throughout my life, and using imagination, I always painted life’s realities with a color of metaphor.  

It was my first exposure to art that gave my life a new meaning. The mystical realm of art has always fascinated me since it combines elements of imagination and reality to reveal the truth. This is why my first serious collection, completed as my capstone university project, was also titled “reality and imagination” This collection actually shows the most fundamental truths of my life: Rebellion effort, dreams, and realities.
