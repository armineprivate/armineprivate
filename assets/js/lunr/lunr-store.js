Overall, that is why most of my ideas remained at the design stage and have not been implemented, with the exception of projects where the client granted me complete freedom; like the mural painting at Tehran Pars High School, which was largely improvised.   From my viewpoint, mural painting has been more of an interactive experience with the city and the people rather than only producing artwork.

Because of my educational background, my painting works have been influenced by graphics design since the beginning. Now, I have developed this influence into an artistic technique.

I use simple and basic tools to make these art pieces from discarded wood blocks.

This is where I set everything free to destroy, build and then destroy once more. This is where I surrender to the subconscious and let the emotions rise from the ashes to forge something with a unique spirit. Here, rage, anger, hatred, pain, and suffering speak up openly. Maybe we should dig for everyone’s reality right here.   In general, when I paint an abstract piece, I do not concentrate on the tools and techniques. I employ both conventional and unconventional methods, such as (but not limited to) tinkering with colors, striking with a brush, setting on fire, and tearing. These choices all depend on the mental state and the creative process.   I believe abstract works are more personal to me because they are less understood by others. These are part of my loneliness.

We studied a variety of printmaking techniques, such as etching, mono print, and linocut. Linocut was my favorite because of how appealing and genuine its fully contrasting atmosphere was to me. Additionally, this technique did not call for any expensive or sophisticated instruments, which for me as a student, made it much more practical.   After all, unlike other mediums which sometimes tend to be tedious and daunting, I find the printmaking process to be always pleasant and fun. In printmaking, before anything else, I feel engaged with the form, tool, and technique, all of which are a source of tranquility for me.

Drawing has always attracted me since it allows me to express myself freely, allows me to improvise without worrying and fears, and enables me to overcome whatever mental blocks I may have.   As I have taken a more academic approach to it, this early interest of mine has developed and flourished. Each workshop I took, each practice I had, and each life experience that I had, has deepened this fascination.

I draw every day simply with a pen or pencil on paper. My focus areas in the drawing have been experiencing and curiosity in the realm of techniques, as well as exploring the form, ideal, and their interaction. I find this triangulation of experience, intuition, and discovery to be my primary artistic route.

Life is full of real imaginations and imaginary realities. I never stopped daydreaming throughout my life, and using imagination, I always painted life’s realities with a color of metaphor.   It was my first exposure to art that gave my life a new meaning. The mystical realm of art has always fascinated me since it combines elements of imagination and reality to reveal the truth.

The details and embellishments here are irrelevant and are only to deceive the mind and show the superficial side of the personality.

Everybody has friends who can recognize their deepest emotions by the slightest shift in their facial expressions.   I have started making tiny paintings of my friends as a mean to discover and display human emotions and mentality.

When working on a piece, I’m always on the lookout for moments of humanity and purity. In this collection of self-portraits, I have drawn exaggerated facial expressions to convey the emotional turbulences going inside me despite my seemingly calm face.

But I made an effort to capture a human moment with all of its nuances. Men are seen falling from the air, and the woman in the collection’s center is shown collapsing within herself with her hands tied. Each person is alone in their own frame but has an invisible yet tangible bond with the others.   Everything appears to be clear. However, is a hasty and superficial interpretation sufficient when one may imagine himself in each shot and the entire work and think back on his previous relationships?

To create this collection, snapped pictures of the individuals around me as they went about their daily business, and then blended their states with my innermost feelings.   The results were pieces that one might say are a college of people’s face on my psychical space. This is, in fact, a metaphor for our personal perception of each person around us.

I have experienced that moment independent of form, motif, and narrative. In this collection, I revert to that moment of encounter with Mosè di Michelangelo and try to present a tale of an unknown moment.   When viewing this collection, I want the viewers to associate their own prior experiences to the impressions they experience while seeing this collection.

Instead of adding colors to the canvas, I usually take them off.  This approach - which is in fact, a type of obsession or a failed perfectionism- end consequence of shame and imperfection notions that have plagued me from childhood. I became immediately consumed with a lust for perfection as a result. However, extreme perfectionism like this inevitably leads to failure. This is my life. It may seem like madness, but it is sure creative.                                                                                                                                                  Storyteller, oil painting on canvas, 100 * 120 cm       I am often told that my works are incomplete as if they were left unfinished. In reality, this is how our lives have unfolded, and my work is a direct result of living in such a society. Thus, I do not perceive any flaws in here. We quite often consider life in Iran to be transitory. Everything for us is slippery and transient. As if we are on a journey, rather at homes. This lifestyle is partially due to our most ancient beliefs and also due to our predisposition to emigrate in search of a better life. Even on the surface, our lives seem semi-finished and temporary, much like the countless abandoned construction sites scattered around the country.

This story is a reflection of pains still with us despite the passage of many centuries: Our engagement with the concept of morality, a society that is immoral yet morality-centered society, moral codes that are not founded in reason, moralities shaken by doubt, and people torn by contradictions. The art pieces in this collection do not directly associate with a story within the book. When reading the book, my mind conjured up atmospheres, related metaphorically to this important literature piece. Then, I arranged the figures together in a sketch and gradually approached the final stage of the drawing with the process explained before.

My love for cinema was another inspiration for me to create video arts. In the making process, I handle every step, from idea development to shooting and montaging, by myself.   Improvisation plays a significant role in the creation of my video art, as it does in the majority of my works. I basically tried to reconstruct my inner and mental space in the videos I have already made. I suppose you could say that each of my video arts is a self-portrait.                                                               ","categories": [],

    "excerpt":"Download my CV as PDF Download my Portfolio as PDF   I can describe myself as a curious, insurgent, and creative artist and a bit of an idealist. I graduated in painting from the University of Tehran. Throughout my education, I made use of a wide range of tools, techniques, and mediums, from the visual arts to cinema and literature, and this practice has continued into my professional life until today.   The mystical realm of art has always fascinated me since it combines elements of imagination and reality to reveal the truth. I believe the term “Reality and Imagination,” which was the title of my earliest project, best describes my work, which includes elements of both.   Classical art fascinates me, but I also have a passion for contemporary art that exudes a sense of serenity and depth, creating an atmosphere conducive to contemplation and spirituality. What inspires me is a kind of revelation I have while improvising, which is particularly prominent in my works.   I take inspiration from philosophy, psychology, and mythology. In parallel to creating art pieces as the defining pillar of my identity, I try to engage in literature, filmmaking, and other endeavors, aiming to expand my life’s and profession’s horizons.   I have worked professionally as an artist for twelve years and have had five solo and four group exhibitions in Tehran, Shiraz, and Karaj. I participated in several festivals and workshops, all listed in my CV section.   “Being different is neither a good nor a bad thing.

I never stopped daydreaming throughout my life, and using imagination, I always painted life’s realities with a color of metaphor.   It was my first exposure to art that gave my life a new meaning. The mystical realm of art has always fascinated me since it combines elements of imagination and reality to reveal the truth.
