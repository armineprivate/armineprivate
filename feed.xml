<p>As a medium that augments many possibilities to the pictures, video art has always piqued my interest. My love for cinema was another inspiration for me to create video arts. In the making process, I handle every step, from idea development to shooting and montaging, by myself.</p>

<p>Improvisation plays a significant role in the creation of my video art, as it does in the majority of my works. I basically tried to reconstruct my inner and mental space in the videos I have already made. I suppose you could say that each of my video arts is a self-portrait.</p>

<p>My creations often take their ultimate forms through destruction rather than creation. Instead of adding colors to the canvas, I usually take them off. 
This approach - which is in fact, a type of obsession or a failed perfectionism- end consequence of shame and imperfection notions that have plagued me from childhood. I became immediately consumed with a lust for perfection as a result. However, extreme perfectionism like this inevitably leads to failure.
This is my life. It may seem like madness, but it is sure creative.</p>

<p>I am often told that my works are incomplete as if they were left unfinished. In reality, this is how our lives have unfolded, and my work is a direct result of living in such a society. Thus, I do not perceive any flaws in here.
We quite often consider life in Iran to be transitory. Everything for us is slippery and transient. As if we are on a journey, rather at homes. This lifestyle is partially due to our most ancient beliefs and also due to our predisposition to emigrate in search of a better life. Even on the surface, our lives seem semi-finished and temporary, much like the countless abandoned construction sites scattered around the country.</p>

<p>How come “One Thousand and One Nights” though? This story is a reflection of pains still with us despite the passage of many centuries: Our engagement with the concept of morality, a society that is immoral yet morality-centered society, moral codes that are not founded in reason, moralities shaken by doubt, and people torn by contradictions.
The art pieces in this collection do not directly associate with a story within the book. When reading the book, my mind conjured up atmospheres, related metaphorically to this important literature piece. Then, I arranged the figures together in a sketch and gradually approached the final stage of the drawing with the process explained before.</p>

<p>When I first saw Michelangelo’s sculpture of Moses, I realized that it represented something more than the character in the books, just as it presumably did for the artist, who used marble to chisel something more than a prophet. I have experienced that moment independent of form, motif, and narrative. In this collection, I revert to that moment of encounter with Mosè di Michelangelo and try to present a tale of an unknown moment.</p>

<p>When viewing this collection, I want the viewers to associate their own prior experiences to the impressions they experience while seeing this collection.</p>

<p>During my stay in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/learak.house/">Learak House</a>, I portrayed the people whom we lived there with me. To create this collection, snapped pictures of the individuals around me as they went about their daily business, and then blended their states with my innermost feelings.</p>

<p>The results were pieces that one might say are a college of people’s face on my psychical space. This is, in fact, a metaphor for our personal perception of each person around us.</p>

<p>The intricate connections between men and women are the focus of the collection “fall,” but it does not intend to represent any defined idea. But I made an effort to capture a human moment with all of its nuances. Men are seen falling from the air, and the woman in the collection’s center is shown collapsing within herself with her hands tied. Each person is alone in their own frame but has an invisible yet tangible bond with the others.</p>

<p>Everything appears to be clear. However, is a hasty and superficial interpretation sufficient when one may imagine himself in each shot and the entire work and think back on his previous relationships?</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for an artist to use himself as the main subject of a work in order to investigate any concepts he is interested in, within himself and without intermediaries. When working on a piece, I’m always on the lookout for moments of humanity and purity. In this collection of self-portraits, I have drawn exaggerated facial expressions to convey the emotional turbulences going inside me despite my seemingly calm face.</p>

<p>These oil paintings, which are on small 15 by 17 centimeters canvases, focus on the face as a representation of human emotions in their most apparent form. Everybody has friends who can recognize their deepest emotions by the slightest shift in their facial expressions.</p>

<p>I have started making tiny paintings of my friends as a mean to discover and display human emotions and mentality.</p>

<p>When people are lonely and struggling with mental conflicts, It feels as though they are sharing their personality and existence with an unknown other.
In this collection entitled doppelganger, I wanted to use deformation to convey the subject’s emotions alongside unknown faces. My intention was to expose people’s personalities along with what is hidden deep beneath their faces and lives. The details and embellishments here are irrelevant and are only to deceive the mind and show the superficial side of the personality.</p>

<p>Reality and imagination are intertwined like the braided hair of a woman. Life is full of real imaginations and imaginary realities. I never stopped daydreaming throughout my life, and using imagination, I always painted life’s realities with a color of metaphor.</p>

<p>It was my first exposure to art that gave my life a new meaning. The mystical realm of art has always fascinated me since it combines elements of imagination and reality to reveal the truth. This is why my first serious collection, completed as my capstone university project, was also titled “reality and imagination” This collection actually shows the most fundamental truths of my life: Rebellion effort, dreams, and realities.</p>

<p>Drawing, as an obsession, study, practice, and also as a method of thinking and imagining, takes up a significant portion of my daily routine.</p>

<p>Drawing has always attracted me since it allows me to express myself freely, allows me to improvise without worrying and fears, and enables me to overcome whatever mental blocks I may have.</p>

<p>As I have taken a more academic approach to it, this early interest of mine has developed and flourished. Each workshop I took, each practice I had, and each life experience that I had, has deepened this fascination.</p>

<p>In my notebooks are my experiences, studies, research, ideas, and also practicing by copying the work of others. I draw every day simply with a pen or pencil on paper. My focus areas in the drawing have been experiencing and curiosity in the realm of techniques, as well as exploring the form, ideal, and their interaction. I find this triangulation of experience, intuition, and discovery to be my primary artistic route.</p>
