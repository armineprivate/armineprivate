When people are lonely and struggling with mental conflicts, It feels as though they are sharing their personality and existence with an unknown other.
In this collection entitled doppelganger, I wanted to use deformation to convey the subject’s emotions alongside unknown faces. My intention was to expose people’s personalities along with what is hidden deep beneath their faces and lives. The details and embellishments here are irrelevant and are only to deceive the mind and show the superficial side of the personality.
