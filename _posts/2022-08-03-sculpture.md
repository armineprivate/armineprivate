I occasionally create tiny wooden sculptures to better understand and experience with the three-dimensional space in art. I use simple and basic tools to make these art pieces from discarded wood blocks. The sculptures, which resemble chess pieces or totems, were made improvised and without a prior design, just like most of my works. For me, creating these miniature sculptures is always a delightful and pure experience.
