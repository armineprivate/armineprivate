I majored in graphic design in high school. Currently, now and then, I make graphic designs. Because of my educational background, my painting works have been influenced by graphics design since the beginning. Now, I have developed this influence into an artistic technique.

Moreover, graphic design is particularly important to me as an Iranian artist since it has played a significant role in Iran's visual art history, from book illustrations to decorative elements and architectural ornamentation.
