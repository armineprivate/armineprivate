In this collection entitled image, I wanted to indicate the emotions of people by using deformation. I chose this way to present characters that hide behind their faces. It looks like we share our personality with the Unknown under psychological conflicts. The non-relevant details are to deceive the mind and also to show the superficial dimension of personality.
