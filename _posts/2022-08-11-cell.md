It is not uncommon for an artist to use himself as the main subject of a work in order to investigate any concepts he is interested in, within himself and without intermediaries. When working on a piece, I’m always on the lookout for moments of humanity and purity. In this collection of self-portraits, I have drawn exaggerated facial expressions to convey the emotional turbulences going inside me despite my seemingly calm face.
