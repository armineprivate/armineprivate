The intricate connections between men and women are the focus of the collection “fall,” but it does not intend to represent any defined idea. But I made an effort to capture a human moment with all of its nuances. Men are seen falling from the air, and the woman in the collection’s center is shown collapsing within herself with her hands tied. Each person is alone in their own frame but has an invisible yet tangible bond with the others. 
Everything appears to be clear. However, is a hasty and superficial interpretation sufficient when one may imagine himself in each shot and the entire work and think back on his previous relationships?
