As a medium that augments many possibilities to the pictures, video art has always piqued my interest. My love for cinema was another inspiration for me to create video arts. In the making process, I handle every step, from idea development to shooting and montaging, by myself.

Improvisation plays a significant role in the creation of my video art, as it does in the majority of my works. I basically tried to reconstruct my inner and mental space in the videos I have already made. I suppose you could say that each of my video arts is a self-portrait.
