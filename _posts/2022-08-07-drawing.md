Drawing, as an obsession, study, practice, and also as a method of thinking and imagining, takes up a significant portion of my daily routine.

Drawing has always attracted me since it allows me to express myself freely, allows me to improvise without worrying and fears, and enables me to overcome whatever mental blocks I may have. 

As I have taken a more academic approach to it, this early interest of mine has developed and flourished. Each workshop I took, each practice I had, and each life experience that I had, has deepened this fascination.

In my notebooks are my experiences, studies, research, ideas, and also practicing by copying the work of others. I draw every day simply with a pen or pencil on paper. My focus areas in the drawing have been experiencing and curiosity in the realm of techniques, as well as exploring the form, ideal, and their interaction. I find this triangulation of experience, intuition, and discovery to be my primary artistic route.
