excerpt: "Reality and imagination are intertwined like the braided hair of women. Life is full of real imaginations and imaginary realities. I never gave up imagining in my life and imagination colors the realities of this world for me with metaphor. My first exposure to art gave new meaning to my life. I have always loved the mysterious world of art because it blurs the boundaries between fantasy and reality to give us the truth. This is why the first collection that I worked on seriously for the final project of the university was on the same subject and under the title of reality and imagination. This collection actually shows the most fundamental truths of my life; Rebellion effort, dreams, and realities."
