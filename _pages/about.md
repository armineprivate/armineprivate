I can describe myself as a curious, insurgent, and creative artist and a bit of an idealist. I graduated in painting from the University of Tehran. Throughout my education, I made use of a wide range of tools, techniques, and mediums, from the visual arts to cinema and literature, and this practice has continued into my professional life until today. 

The mystical realm of art has always fascinated me since it combines elements of imagination and reality to reveal the truth. I believe the term “Reality and Imagination,” which was the title of my earliest project, best describes my work, which includes elements of both.

Classical art fascinates me, but I also have a passion for contemporary art that exudes a sense of serenity and depth, creating an atmosphere conducive to contemplation and spirituality. What inspires me is a kind of revelation I have while improvising, which is particularly prominent in my works.

I take inspiration from philosophy, psychology, and mythology. In parallel to creating art pieces as the defining pillar of my identity, I try to engage in literature, filmmaking, and other endeavors, aiming to expand my life’s and profession’s horizons.

I have worked professionally as an artist for twelve years and have had five solo and four group exhibitions in Tehran, Shiraz, and Karaj. I participated in several festivals and workshops, all listed in my CV section.

“Being different is neither a good nor a bad thing. It just means being brave enough to be yourself.“ Albert Camus
