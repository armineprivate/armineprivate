I can describe myself as a curious, insurgent and creative artist and a bit of an idealist. I graduated in painting from the University of Tehran. During my studies I used different tools, techniques and media, from visual arts to cinema and literature, to make projects and this approach continues until today. I think that reality and imagination are the words closest to my works, the title of one of my projects.
Classic art fascinates me, but at the same time I am passionate about modern art, especially works that are very calm and deep, and look like a space for reflection and spirituality. What fascinates me is a kind of revelation during improvising and it is very prominent in my works.
I am interested in philosophy, psychology and also myth except that creating a work of art is the most pleasant business for me, and I do it sometimes with filming, sometimes with drawing etc. 
I have been working as an artist for twelve years and had four group exhibitions and two solo exhibitions in Tehran and Karaj. I participated in several festivals and workshops such as the festival of religious arts.
